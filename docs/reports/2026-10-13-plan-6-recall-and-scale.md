title: Plan 6 re-measure — recall and scale after six lanes
date: 2026-10-13
valid_until: 2027-04-13
lane: plan 6
verdict: gold recall rose to 0.667 on TypeScript (hono), 1.000 on Go (caddy, 48 labelled sites) and 0.834 pooled with pooled precision 0.995 (all targets met), but the openclaw full build took 499.6 s against the 8 minute target (missed by 20 s) and main is 1.40x slower than B1 alone on hermes-agent
status: done

Measured at main `feef80c` (release build), 2026-10-13. Full tables: `docs/reports/2026-10-12-engine-parity.md`, section
"After Plan 6 (2026-10-13)". The codegraph-mcp head-to-head was not run: it is the founder's timing and is still pending.

## Targets vs measured

| target (plan 6) | measured | met |
|---|---|---|
| TypeScript gold recall >= 0.55 | hono 0.667 (P 1.000), was 0.306 | yes |
| Go gold recall >= 0.60 | caddy 1.000 (P 1.000), was 0.250; 48 labelled sites | yes (small gold) |
| pooled recall >= 0.72 with P >= 0.96 | 0.834 / 0.995 (196 of 197 answered, 196 of 235 sites), was 0.626 / 0.980 | yes |
| openclaw full build < 8 min | 499.6 s (8 m 20 s), 38,258 files, load 11; B1 alone measured 302 s earlier | NO, by 19.6 s |
| unchanged rebuild unchanged | no-op reuse 2.0 s (hermes-agent), 7.5 s (openclaw); incremental store_hash equals `--full` on both trees | yes |
| product repo < 90 s | not re-measured (the private tree was not part of this run) | open |
| crg through the adapter >= native crg | equal on 3 projects, +0.055 / +0.083 recall on hono / caddy; pooled 0.956 / 0.736 vs 0.954 / 0.711 | yes |

## Per lane (from the commits and `docs/design-notes-for-review.md`)

- A0 `984057b`: `scripts/gold-score.sh` and `tests/gold.rs`, the floor test on the committed labels.
- A1 `3b0bda9`: `describe` blocks are function nodes, module-level test code belongs to the file, JSX `<Foo/>` is a 1.0 rendering call through an import or same-file definition, class-field arrows are method nodes, `foo.bar()` resolves through the declared class and its `extends` chain: hono 0.846 / 0.306 to 0.920 / 0.639.
- A2 `194466c`: Go `go_ctx.rs` (declared types, receivers, package table, `go.mod` imports), the 0.5 name-only Go edge removed: caddy recall 0.25 to 1.0; 40 of 40 sampled edges correct.
- A3 `e256ea3`: barrel re-exports followed, the name fallback binds only a sole candidate outside benchmark/example/test dirs, `new X()` binds only a class: hono precision 0.920 to 1.000.
- A4 (limitation collapse) is not in the history: `clamped_line_end` still repeats per file in the hermes-agent and openclaw envelopes.
- B1 `fb6e9e0`, `41adfa8`: per-pass profiling (`COMPAREGRAPH_PROFILE=1`), indexed lookups, parallel per-file analyses: hermes-agent 194 s to 64.5 s on the B1 binary.
- B2 `feef80c`: incremental edges and communities (affected-file closure, copy of the rest); hash equal to `--full`; at 2,600 files it saves little, on openclaw 289.7 s vs 499.2 s.
- B3 `ce8cb00`, `69f3b3b`, `6994e60`: bounded adjacency loading, deterministic tie-breaks; `impact`/`traverse`/`dead-code` on the 1.29M-edge openclaw graph in 2.5 / 3.6 / 1.6 s with 12 to 15 MB RSS.
- C1 `43b9769`, `bdb0af0`, `fc69ddb`: the external engine host over JSON lines; timeouts kill the process group, a failed engine is a failed run row.
- C2 `a04cff7`, `a25f469`: the code-review-graph adapter, conformance gate per language, `build --providers a,b` with an agreement table (srclight: calls J 0.962, imports 0.904, tests 0.594).

## Method

Readers: two language-model agents labelled each gold site independently under one rubric; the committed `final` is the rows they agree on
(kappa table in the parity report, unchanged: labels did not change). Scorer: `scripts/gold-score.sh` with `scripts/lib/gold.py`, the
smallest enclosing function, method or (for module scope) file node, matching the callee's last segment; precision over answered sites,
recall over repo-target sites. Floors: `fixtures/gold/FLOORS.json`, last measured minus 0.01, raised by lanes and never lowered; all
hold. Hash gate: `store_hash` of an incremental build must equal `build --full` of the same tree (equal on both trees here, and in
18 tests). Timing: ratios between binaries measured back to back, on a shared host (load average 5 to 15 on 40 cores during this run,
37 to 73 on 2026-10-13 morning).

## Limits

- The gold has 150 sites per project (36 to 53 repo-target); caddy has 48, all drawn before the Go work, so 1.000 means "every labelled site", and per-project noise is about 0.1.
- Precision samples were 40 (Go) and 25 edges read by agents against the source, not by humans; the wrong-edge bound at 0 of 40 is under about 7 percent at 95 percent confidence.
- Two readers, both agents; the labelling and the engines were not run blind to each other's authors.
- The hono precision of 1.000 rests on 24 answered sites.
- Build timings ran under load 6 to 15; the openclaw miss of 20 s is inside the noise of a single run, but the hermes-agent back-to-back (194.4 s, 64.5 s, 90.5 s) is a real 1.40x regression after B1 and was not diagnosed.
- The product-repo build (<90 s target), the codegraph head-to-head and the private tree were not measured here.
- Query bounds were measured on one hub symbol (3,156 callers), at defaults, one run each.

## What is next

Plan 7 candidates: `docs/superpowers/plans/2026-10-13-plan-7-candidates.md` (B4 per-file analysis cache, edge index, thread override, Go and TS
leftovers, crg adapter gaps, feature stats, port kit). From this run, add: diagnose the resolve_edges slowdown between B1 (10.0 s) and
`feef80c` (30.3 s on hermes-agent; 145 s on openclaw) which also decides the 8 minute target, and finish A4.
